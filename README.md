An 8 bit synthesizer written in tic-80.

# To play
You will need [TIC-80}(https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80), which is great news because TIC-80 is a wonderfull free and open source fantacsy console. It is a really fun way to prototype games and creative projects, and in my case for learning a new scripting language (It also supports Moonscript, JavaScript, Python, Wren etc. although lua is the default scripting language).

Fantasy console projects are a dime a dozen right now but this one is very very good, and one of the few that is completely free. If you aren't a big nerd like me, fantasy consoles are essentially emulators that aim to capture the experience of making things with/using an old machine to make and play games. This one is heavily based on the 8bit MS-BASIC/MSX-DOS/*insert other strange DOS/BASIC variant os or proprietary OS* based computers of the 80s and 90s (Commodore 64, Amstrad etc.) I am not sponsored by TIC-80, I'm just writing all this because I really like the software, and you should too.
